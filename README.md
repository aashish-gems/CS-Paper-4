# CS-Paper-4
Hello!

I made this repository to post the solutions of CIE A Levels Computer Science (9618) Paper 4. Past Papers from Oct/Nov 2021 onwards will be solved here. My solutions may not be the same as the ones in the mark scheme but they'll usually be acceptable as I appeared for May June 2024 Variant 2 myself, receiving a perfect score in Paper 4. 

Newer past papers may take time to be solved and posted, depending on my schedule. But I will try my best to make it available within a few days of their release. 
Please feel free to reach out to me if you see any bugs and errors in my code or if you have any questions. However, I may not be able to personally assist every one of you. 

You can copy and use the code as you wish. However, do not use it for redistribution to earn profit, these resources are completely free for any A Levels student. 

I hope these past papers' solutions help in your preparation.
Happy Learning!
